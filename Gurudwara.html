Gurudwara Bangla Sahib is a prominent house of worship for the Sikh community and tourist spot in Delhi. This 17th-century shrine is dedicated to the memory of Guru Har Krishan, who was the eighth Sikh Guru. Located near Connaught Place, the busiest neighborhood in the national capital, the Gurudwara draws attention due to its magnificent structure, architectural beauty, and the large water body aka ‘Sarovar’ located within the complex.

<h1 style="color:black;font-size:30px;">History</h1><br>
Unlike most other Gurudwaras in the country, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib wasn’t originally built as a shrine. It was initially a bungalow called Jaisinghpura Palace that was owned by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, the ruler of Amber kingdom (later known as Jaipur) and a senior general of the Mughal Empire in the 17th century. In 1664, when Guru Har Krishan visited Delhi, he stayed at this bungalow. Severe cholera and smallpox epidemic broke out in Delhi during the same time. The Guru extended his helping hand for the affected people by offering water from the well located within the bungalow complex. But the Guru himself contracted the ailment and finally died in that same bungalow.
<br>
After his death, Raja Jai Singh dedicated his bungalow to commemorate the revered Guru. Thus, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib came into being and became a major place of worship for the Sikhs. The Raja also built a tank over the well, which is today a distinctive feature of this Gurudwara.
<br>
Over the years, the structure of the original Gurudwara underwent several changes. It was rebuilt by Sardar Bhagel Singh Dhaliwal, a Sikh general, in 1783. The present structure of the Gurudwara, however, was built mostly after 1947.
<br>
<h1 style="color:black;font-size:30px;">Architecture</h1><br>
Gurudwara Bangla Sahib is known as much for its religious significance as for its splendid architecture. The grand edifice is built in the Sikh architecture. While the whole structure is made using white marble, it is topped with a central golden dome which is its distinctive feature. The tall flag mast standing atop the dome is called Nishan Sahib and can be seen from afar. Intricate carvings adorn the front wall of the Gurudwara. The presence of the huge water tank, called Sarovar, inside the complex further enhances the aesthetic beauty of the whole structure. In addition to the Gurudwara and water tank, the complex also contains a community kitchen aka langer, a museum, an art gallery, a school, and a hospital and a library.
<br>
<h1 style="color:black;font-size:30px;">Gurudwara Bangla Sahib Langar</h1><br>
The langar hall at Gurudwara Bangla Sahib serves free vegetarian meals to around 10,000 people every day. This community meal service is extended to all visitors, regardless of caste, creed, race, religion, or economic standing in society. A large number of people also extended their voluntary service at the community kitchen to help prepare the meals.
