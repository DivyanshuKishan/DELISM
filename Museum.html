In the winters of 1947-48, an exhibition on Indian arts and artefacts was set up in the Royal Academy of London. Post the event in London; the exhibition curators intended to display the entire collection in India before returning the antics to the respective individual museums. Therefore in 1949, an exhibition was organized in the premises of Rashtrapati Bhawan. The massive success of the exhibition led to the decision of the formation of a permanent National Museum. On 15th August 1949, the museum housed in Rashtrapati Bhawan was inaugurated by the then Governor-General of India-C. Rajagopalachari.

Later in 1955, the museum was moved to the current location and was formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India- Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in 1960. Until 1957, the museum was run by Director General of Archaeology. Currently, it is maintained and managed by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.
