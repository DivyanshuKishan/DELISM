<h1 style="color:black;font-size:30px;">History</h1>

Swaminarayan Akshardham came into existence as a result of Shri Yogiji Maharaj’s desire to build a temple complex in Delhi. He conceived the idea around 1968 when he was serving as the spiritual head of the Bochasanwasi Sri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sansthan, known at BAPS. However, it was Lord Swaminarayan, his successor in line after Pradhanmantri Swami Maharaj and the fifth spiritual guru who started the construction of the temple.
   <br>
About 60 acres of land was given by Delhi Development Authority and 30 acres by Uttar Pradesh government for the construction of this temple. Construction began in 2000 and was completed within five years. Standing on the banks of river Yamuna, Akshardham Temple was opened to the public on 6 November 2005. The inauguration of the temple was inaugurated by the chief Swami Maharaj. In the presence of eminent personalities like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, L.K. Advani, B.L. Joshi, and Drs. Manmohan Singh – the then Prime Minister of India. Perhaps the biggest sanctuary in India just as Delhi, this spiritual place was constructed by BAPS. More than 8000 volunteers participated in the construction of this temple and spent 300,000,000 volunteer hours.<br>
