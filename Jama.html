<h1 style="color:black;font-size:30px;">History</h1>
It was Shah Jahan who built the Jama Masjid in the walled city of Shahjahanabad (or Old Delhi as it is known today), which was the capital of the Mughal Empire during his reign. The construction of the mosque began in 1644 and went on for long twelve years before it was completed in 1656. More than 5000 workers were engaged in the construction work, supervised by Saadullah Khan, the prime minister of the Emperor. Shah Jahan spared no expenses to build this grand monument and it was built at a cost of one million rupees.
<br>
Initially, the mosque was named Masjid-i-Jahan Numa, which means ‘the Mosque that Reflects the World’. Later, it came to be known as Jama Masjid or the Friday Mosque. The inauguration of the mosque took place on 23 July 1656 by an Imam named Abdul Ghafoor Shah Bukhari, who came all the way from Bukhara (now Uzbekistan) at Shah Jahan’s invitation. He was also appointed the first Shahi Imam of the mosque by Shah Jahan.
<br>
Since its construction, the masjid has been standing tall in the city right next to another iconic monument built by Shah Jahan, namely the Red Fort. Till the end of the Mughal era, it was the royal mosque of the emperors. After the Revolt of 1857, the victorious British rulers seized the mosque with the intention to destroy it. However, strong opposition from the public made them reconsider this decision and the structure was spared any damage. Currently, the masjid is under the control of Delhi Waqf Board.
<br>

The Jama Masjid in Delhi is considered to be the finest mosque constructed during the Mughal Empire. Built using red sandstone and white marble in Indo-Islamic architectural style, it has a length of about 261 feet and a width of 90 feet. The structure is adorned with three huge arched gates, three marble domes, four towers, and two towering minarets. It also has a sprawling courtyard that can accommodate more than 25,000 people for prayers at a time.
<br>
Out of the three gateways to the mosque, the one on the eastern side has 35 steps leading to it. This gate is also known as the royal entrance since it was reserved for use of Mughal Emperors. The gates on the northern and southern sides have 39 and 33 steps, respectively. Each of the two minarets comprises of five stories with a protruding balcony and reaches up to a height of 130 feet. There are 130 steps inside each minaret to climb to the top.

The mosque has a strikingly designed black and white marble floor with 899 bordered spaces demarcated for worshippers. Lavish arches, floral designs, and fluorescent motifs adorn the interiors of this mosque. The archway to the center of the prayer hall has the words ‘The Guide’ written on it. The significant relics at the mosque include a copy of the Quran written on deerskin, a red hair from the beard of Prophet Mohammed, a pair of his footwear, and his footprints on a marble block.
